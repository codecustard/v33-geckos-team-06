# How To Contribute

### Forking and Cloning
- Fork this repository by visiting this link: https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v33-geckos-team-06 and clicking on the Fork button. Make sure you are logged into your Github profile. You should see the Forked version at: https://github.com/your-profile-name/v33-geckos-team-06
- Go to your forked repository `your-github-name/v33-geckos-team-06` and click on the Code button. Copy the link, which should look like something similar: https://github.com/your-profile-name/v33-geckos-team-06.git
- On your local machine, in the terminal clone your forked repository with the following command with the link from the previous step: 

     `git clone https://github.com/your-profile-name/v33-geckos-team-06`


### Updating Your Branch
While you are working on your task, your local branch may be behind because other's have merged pull requests into the main repository. To keep the branch that you are working on up-to-date so that there are no merging conflicts when you are ready to submit, you need to `rebase` onto the main branch of the main repository. To do that, run the following command:

```git pull --rebase upstream main```

### Pushing Your Changes to Your Github Fork and Submitting a Pull Request
Type the following command to push to your forked repository on Github:
```git push origin your-branch-name```

Github should automatically detect that a new branch was submitted and ask if you would like to create a pull request for the branch that you just published. Create a pull request and request team members to review, especially anyone that might be working on something related to your task.

Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For 
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point -

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.
